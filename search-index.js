How integration services use Tekton test pipelines and test scenarios 2. Creating an individual Tekton task 3. Creating a Tekton bundle image 4. Creating an integration test scenario To create a custom application test, you must create a Tekton test pipeline. The test pipeline consists of a single definition that could be executed as two logically distinct pipeline runs by the Integration Service. The Integration Service executes the test pipeline and tests the application. The Integration Service has two different stages: Component stage: when you build a single component image, the Integration Service tests the application using only that components updated to use the newly built image. Composite stage: when you build multiple components at the same time, the Integration Service tests the application, using multiple components updated to use the newly built images. A new custom resource (CR) called IntegrationTestScenario describes separate PipelineRuns that run by the snapshot controller. Each IntegrationTestScenario includes information regarding the executed Tekton pipeline: The Tekton bundle image The pipeline name and paramaters The environment details Use the IntegrationTestScenario to: Specify where the pipeline will be applied Define if the test scenario runs in the component stage, the composite stage, or both The ephemeral environment is the copy of an existing environment that the Integration Service created for a specific integration pipeline run. When the Integration Service creates an ephemeral environment, it creates the following actions: The Integration Service creates the, ApplicationSnapshotEnvironmentBinding that links the ApplicationSnapshot with the Environment. The GitOps service deploys the Snapshot on the new Environment The Integration Service links the credentials for the Environment to the Integration Tekton pipeline run. The Integration Service starts the test run. To create a custom application test, go to: Creating a Tekton bundle image Creating an individual Tekton task Creating an integration test scenario An individual Tekton task contains the results that the Integration Service reads. Proceudre In your framework, build your Tekton task containing the standardized HACBS Tekton task output (HACBS_TEST_OUTPUT) which is saved as the result of the Task: apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1 kind: Task metadata: name: test-output spec: results: - name: HACBS_TEST_OUTPUT description: Test output params: - default: \"SUCCESS\" name: RESULT description: Test result to be generated steps: - image: quay.io/redhat-appstudio/hacbs-test:stable script: | HACBS_TEST_OUTPUT=$(jq -rc --arg date $(date +%s) --arg RESULT $(params.RESULT) --null-input \\ '{result: $RESULT, timestamp: $date, failures: 0, successes: 0}') echo \"${HACBS_TEST_OUTPUT}\" | tee $(results.HACBS_TEST_OUTPUT.path) Store the output in the Task’s workspace under the name convention, test_name_output.json. Push the Tekton bundle image into your designated repository: tkn bundle push quay.io/YOUR_REPO_HERE/test-bundle:test-output -f tasks/tekton_task.yaml Create a Tekton bundle image to package a pipeline. In order to make a Tekton bundle, the Tekton tasks must point to Tekton bundle images. After you package the pipeline, the Integration Service can run it as a bundle. Both the Build and Release Service utilize bundles.

When this ConfigMap is present, the build service operator configures the necessary in a workspace. To speed up the build process and reduce the load on Maven Central, this ConfigMap currently creates an artifact cache that caches Maven objects. When building an application, the system redirects all requests by using this artifact cache. By default this proxies to maven central, however, you can configure other repositories.

Additional resources Java applications download all of their dependencies as pre-compiled binaries from repositories such as Maven Central. While these pre-compiled binaries are convenient, they do not assure the origin of the dependency, and you cannot ensure that the binary artifact matches the open source code. Therefore, Java is different from languages like golang, which use source code-based dependencies. The JVM build service addressed this concern by allowing you to rebuild your application dependencies from the source automatically. Subsequently, you can assure the origin of your dependencies. Workflow The system builds your application by using community dependencies. The JVM Build Service analyzes your application and determines the dependencies that the system needs to be rebuilt. It generates ArtifactBuild objects to represent each artifact in your application before determining from which repository and tag the system has derives these artifacts. The system analyzes the repository, and uses the results to find a build strategy (which can involve trial and error, for example, if the system cannot find the JDK version to use it will use them all in a specific order) The system attempts to build all the dependencies and stores them in a persistent storage, for example, an S3-based Artifact Store. When the system has completed all its builds you can rebuild your application. If all the builds are successful, your application’s SBOM displays that none of the dependencies came from third-party repositories.

Managed environment team - The team that supports the production instance of that application. [1] When an application is ready for release, the Development team contacts the Managed Environment team; for example, their organization’s SRE team, requesting access to the Managed environment for the first production release. [2] The Managed environment team creates the managed environment and responds to the development team with the managed environment’s configuration details.

Component tests 2.2. Integration Service tests 3. Additional Resources HACBS has four components, one of which is the test component. The test component works throughout the pipeline process to ensure yyour application and its components comply with basic tests, like sanity, security, or tests you add to the application. The test component ensures all application components work in congruence with integration testing. Furthermore, administrator defined Enterprise Contract(EC) uses the test component to ensure your application complies with organizational and legal standards. For both component and integration testing, you can create your own tests to ensure your application meets your standards and needs. There are currently 3 types of image tests in HACBS. * Sanity Tests * Product Security Tests * Custom Tests. By default, HACBS performs Sanity and Product Security tests. You specifically create the Custom tests for your application. Sanity Tests in HACBS ensure the stability of the application, the build pipeline, its components, and the environment in which it is being tested. The sanity tests used in HACBS are executed in the form of Tekton tasks. The utility used for validating container information is conftest. A full listing of HACBS Sanity Tests can be found here. Product Security tests in HACBS ensure a product is secure and keep you image, application, and build pipeline up to date. Product Security tests include: Vulnerability scanning Code scanning Image testing Result reporting These tests can be made mandatory as part of the Enterprise Contract Custom tests in HACBS are tests that are created and implemented by users and administrators. You can add tests to your environment as needed. Custom tests are written as tekton tasks and implemented into your pipeline. For full instructions on creating and importing tests, please see our guide . Integration tests occur after each component included in the build has passed testing. Integration testing ensures that all build components are able to work together at the same time. Images of all the application components are compiled into an application snapshot. The application snapshot is then tested against user defined test scenarios, which refer to a tekton bundle. All images created are stored in a Quay.io repository. If all integration tests pass, a ReleaseLink is created. The ReleaseLink will notify the release service that the application is ready to be promoted to the next environment.

How integration services use Tekton test pipelines and test scenarios 2. Creating a Tekton bundle image 3. Creating an individual Tekton task 4. Creating an integration test scenario To create a custom application test, you must create a Tekton test pipeline. The test pipeline consists of a single definition that could be executed as two logically distinct pipeline runs by the Integration Service. The Integration Service executes the test pipeline and tests the application. The Integration Service has two different stages: Component stage: when you build a single component image, the Integration Service tests the application using only that components updated to use the newly built image. Composite stage: when you build multiple components at the same time, the Integration Service tests the application, using multiple components updated to use the newly built images. A new custom resource (CR) called IntegrationTestScenario describes separate PipelineRuns that run by the snapshot controller. Each IntegrationTestScenario includes information regarding the executed Tekton pipeline: The Tekton bundle image The pipeline name and paramaters The environment details Use the IntegrationTestScenario to: Specify where the pipeline will be applied Define if the test scenario runs in the component stage, the composite stage, or both The ephemeral environment is the copy of an existing environment that the Integration Service created for a specific integration pipeline run. When the Integration Service creates an ephemeral environment, it creates the following actions: The Integration Service creates the, ApplicationSnapshotEnvironmentBinding that links the ApplicationSnapshot with the the Environment. The GitOps service deploys the Snapshot on the new Environment The Integration Service links the credentials for the Environment to the Integration Tekton pipeline run. The Integration Service starts the test run.

A Kubernetes deployment, which includes nodes that run containerized applications, and a control plane that manages the nodes. A change to one or more files. In Stonesoup, commits that you make to a linked repository move through the pipeline and automatically get published. An image that Stonesoup typically builds from code in a source repository. One or more components that run together form an application. A utility for testing structured configuration data. Use Conftest to validate container information. A set of release policies that you apply to your managed environment. Use the EC to prevent the release of Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) that are non-compliant. A temporary environment that executes each integration scenario. The system creates these environments dynamically on demand and then removes them after completing the build pipeline. A pipeline that you set up in GitHub. As you add components, it tests each one individually, and then tests the application as a whole. A process that uses Tekton tasks to support the setup and execution of dynamic application tests against container images. A parameter that the Integration Service uses to test the application components. A group of utilities that accelerates build times, locates dependencies in final images, and meets product security requirements by managing the construction of Java dependencies. The processes that automatically occur after a merge or pull request is resolved. These processes may include build and integration tests, as well as TaskRuns. An application release target. A separate Managed Environment team, such as an Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, manages the environment, which exists in an external workspace. A workspace that mirrors some details of an already existing workspace. Supporting teams can create a managed workspace to grant limited permissions to development teams in the production environment. The layered image build service, or OSBS (derived from OpenShift Build Service), is a tool for building layered images. With OSBS features, you can build base RHEL images, layered images, and the builder image itself. A component that moves the Pipeline output, which is all of the relevant PipelineRun information, to an external storage that is outside the cluster’s etcd database, after the system completes PipelineRun. A practice that defines pipelines with source code in Git. Pipelines as Code is also the name of a subsystem that executes those pipelines. Systems that retain the history and details of builds. A collection of TaskRuns that are arranged in a specific order of execution. A valid Pipeline is compliant with the customer’s enterprise contract. A managed service that securely runs Tekton Pipelines. It also stores the metadata and Pipeline logs that are related to an executed Pipeline in a separate database. A test that assesses the security of build inputs and outputs with vulnerability scanning, code scanning, image testing, and result reporting. It also identifies outdated images, applications, and build pipelines. A component that removes resources that are associated with the completed PipelineRuns. The system assigns resources, such as pods, to every PipelineRun. Without a pruner, these resources remain in the cluster indefinitely, even after the system completes the PipelineRun. A pipeline that defines the process for validating snapshots against the enterprise contract. They also provide an array of release destinations other than GitOps deployments. A process that determines if images meet security quality standards. Mechanisms that use Tekton chains to extract and store the metadata of the PipelineRuns, sign that metadata, and then store it in the image registry adjacent to the Component image. A set of component and container images that specifies which components should be deployed with which container images. The system creates a snapshot when it finishes running a component’s build pipeline. A set of compute resources that you can use to develop, test, and stage your applications before you release them. You can share static environments across all applications in the workspace. A platform to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications to the hybrid cloud. Stonesoup offers enterprise-grade security and customizable feature sets. A security framework that helps prevent tampering by securing the packages and infrastructure of customers’ projects. One or more steps that run container images. Each container image performs a piece of construction work. A process that executes a Task on a cluster with inputs, outputs, and execution parameters. The system creates a TaskRun on its own or as a part of a PipelineRun for each task in a pipeline. Tekton is a Knative-based framework for CI/CD pipelines. Tekton is decoupled which means that you can use one pipeline to deploy to any Kubernetes cluster across multiple hybrid cloud providers. Tekton stores everything that is related to a pipeline in the cluster, so you can use the cluster across multiple pipelines. A mechanism to secure the software supply chain by recording events in a user-defined pipeline. Storage volume that a Task requires at runtime to receive input or provide output.","title":"Glossary","component":"ROOT","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/glossary/index.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

How HACBS enterprise contract helps you 2. How Pipelines and HACBS enterprise contract works 3. Additional resources The main goal of the enterprise contract (EC) is to prevent the release of SLSA non-compliant artifacts. Organizations can implement their policies by expressing them as criteria for valid artifacts within the EC. Developers then access the EC as an object inside the KCP workspace. As a developer, reference the EC to verify what must be true about your build and how to make your artifacts compliant with your organization’s needs and policies. The EC evaluates the policy definitions against the collected provenance data, ensuring that the build process complies with the enterprise policy. Some examples of the EC policy rules include the following: Verify a set of Tekton Tasks were executed. For example, the EC can assert that a Tekton Task which performs anti-virus checks was successfully executed. Verify all used Tekton Tasks match an expected version and origin. Verify built artifacts have been properly signed by an expected signature key. The EC establishes a valid set of Tekton Tasks and Tekton Pipelines based on the customer, enterprise, and security needs and standards. Given that a Tekton Pipeline is composed of various Tekton Tasks, the EC leverages Tekton Chains to capture the details of a Tekton Pipeline execution in a signed SLSA Provenance attestation. Users simply run a Tekton Pipeline to build artifacts, like a container image, while Tekton Chains automatically generates the corresponding signed SLSA Provenance attestation. When applied, the EC verifies that the SLSA provenance attestation conforms to the configured EC policy. When the artifact produced is a container image, the signed SLSA Provenance attestation is stored alongside the container image in the same repository. In addition to the attestation, the container image is also signed by Tekton Chains. This signature is also stored in the same location. The EC is responsible for ensuring the image signature and the signed SLSA Provenance attestation exist and are accurate. To learn more about HACBS EC, see: Enterprise Contract To learn about other HACBS streams that help you with your containerized development needs, see: Application testing Release strategy Pipelines","title":"Overview of HACBS enterprise contract","component":"ROOT","version":"master","name":"con_enterprise-contract-overview","url":"/concepts/enterprise-contract/con_enterprise-contract-overview.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Managed environment Environments are standalone pieces of infrastructure that you can use to develop, test, and release your code to production. You can create two types of environments in HACBS: Static environments Managed environments Additionally, the system creates and manages the third type of environment, Ephemeral environments. The system creates these temporary environments dynamically on demand and removes them after completing the build pipeline. The system uses these temporary environments to execute each integration scenario. Static environments are abstract spaces in your current workspace where you can safely deploy and test your code (either manually or automatically) without breaking published applications in production. A Static environment is available to all the applications within the same workspace, but can only have one running instance of each application. Since you cannot run multiple versions of the same application in the same Static environment, deploying a new version of an application will replace the one it currently runs. Managed environments are user-facing workspaces where you link your applications to deploy them to production. This environment is managed by your organization’s Managed environment team, for example, SREs.

Additional resources Dependency Analyzer Build Database Cache Dependency Analyzer is responsible for determining all the dependencies in a Java application. The Dependency Analyzer task analyzes the completed application to find theh dependencies in the final application. It then creates the ArtifactBuild objects that tell the system to try to rebuild any dependencies from 3rd party repositories. The Build Database consists of one or more .git repositories containing information about how to build projects, for example, SCM locations and build parameters. The system stores all this information in the ./build-info and ./scm-info directories. In addition, you can configure your own build database by adding the following data: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: jvm-build-config namespace: test-jvm-namespace data: registry.owner: OrgID (1) 1 The organization ID. You can use the caching service to improve the performance. The cache is a Quarkus application and is configured via standard Quarkus configuration keys. That means any config key listed here can be overridden by both system properties, or by environment variables. Issue: Missing artifact build Resolution Identify the source from where the system is building the application. When identified, if missing, add the source URL and tags to the scm.yaml file: Example scm.yaml file type: \"git\" uri: \"https://gitlab.ow2.org/asm/asm.git\" tagMapping: - pattern: (\\d+)\\.(\\d+) tag: ASM_$1_$2 - pattern: (\\d+)\\.(\\d+)\\.(\\d+) tag: ASM_$1_$2_$3 Issue: Dependencies failed to rebuild Resolution: You can resolve this error by adding additional build arguments or by following the trial and error route. Example additional build arguments additionalArgs: - \"-DskipDocs=true\" - \"-Dno-test-modules\" The ./build-info and ./scm-info directories consist of all the build information. The layout of this directory is based on the group id of the ArtifactBuild. For example, in the case of an ArtifactBuild with the group id of com.acme, you must store its information in the /build-info/com/acme folder. Within this group id directory, you can store more specific information that is only applied to a specific artifact, version, or combination of artifact + version. You can store these types of information by using the _artifact and _version folders. When you use both _artifact and _version folders, the _artifact folder takes precedence over the _version folder. Example If you have an artifact com.acme.gizmo:gizmo-core:1.0.0.Final you can place the files relevant to this artifact at different locations. /build-info/com/acme/gizo - Applied to every artifact with the group id com.acme.gizmo. This is the most common layout and most of the artifacts with a given group id come from the same directory /build-info/com/acme/gizo/_artifact/gizmo-core - Provides information about a specific artifact. This is helpful when lots of different repositories build artifacts with the same group id /build-info/com/acme/gizo/_artifact/gizmo-core/_version/1.0.0.Final - Contains information about a specific version of a specific artifact /build-info/com/acme/gizo/_version/1.0.0.Final - Contains information about a specific version of a specific group id For more information, see Java build service.","title":"Java build service components","component":"ROOT","version":"master","name":"java-build-service-components","url":"/concepts/java-build-service/java-build-service-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Additional resources Pipelines service is a managed service that allows users or services to securely run Tekton Pipelines on Kubernetes Control Plane (KCP). Additionally, it stores the metadata and Pipeline logs related to an executed Pipeline in a separate database. Exposes a subset of Tekton API by using an integral generic and managed CI service. Red Hat does not expose TaskRun API. Provides transparent multi-cluster and multi-tenancy by using KCP. Provides generic constructs, for example, Tasks for building and executing Pipeline. Scalable deployment processes by using standard Tekton constructs. Offers core framework for running builds. Pipelines service has many components responsible for various tasks, for example, pruning or logs. Main components of the Pipelines service are: Pipeline as Code Pipelines Signature and Provenance Pruner Persister Pipelines service provides Pipeline as Code. Pipeline as code is a practice of defining pipelines through source code, such as Git. You can connect OpenShift Pipelines and a git repository using Pipeline as Code. As a result, the system can generate a PR and run Pipelines on the cluster. The Pipelines are one of the most critical components of the system. They expose a subset of the tekton-pipeline API, which is responsible for maintaining and running all the Pipelines within the system. HACBS makes use of this ability. It uses Tekton chains to extract metadata of the PipelineRuns, sign that metadata, and then store it in an external database (Recor). The Signature and Provenance component also stores metadata. The system assigns resources to every PipelineRun, for example, pods. These resources remain in the cluster indefinitely, even after the system completes the PipelineRun. The Pruner component is in charge of removing resources associated with the completed PipelineRuns. Currently the system only prunes the TasksRun and PVC (Persistent Volume Claims). When the system completes a PipelineRun, the Persister component moves all the relevant PipelineRun information to an external storage, that is, outside the cluster’s etcd database. The system only displays the five latest Pipeline runs. You can access the data of the older Pipeline runs from the archive. You can use a Pipelines service in any of the following ways. Git A Git repository drives the pipeline definition and configuration. The Pipeline service receives Git events from the repository and executes the pipeline based on the definition and configurations in the Git repository. Run To execute your PipelineRun and TaskRun resources, provide them as embedded specs or bundles to the Pipeline service. The Pipeline service executes these resources, but you maintain control over the pipeline definitions.

A TaskRun creates a Task for execution on a cluster with particular inputs, outputs, and execution parameters. You can use the task independently or as part of a PipelineRun for each Task in the pipeline. Each Task consists of one or more Steps that run container images. Each container image does a specific piece of construction work. A TaskRun performs the Steps in a Task in the provided order until all Steps succeed or the Task fails. A PipelineRun creates a TaskRun for each Task in a Pipeline automatically.

You can use them to construct complex workflows that automate the build, deployment, and delivery of applications. You can define a CI/CD workflow for your application using pipelines containing one or more tasks. A Pipeline resource definition consists of several fields or attributes, which together enable the pipeline to carry out a specific goal. Each Pipeline resource definition must contain at least one Task resource, which ingests specific inputs and produces specific outputs. The pipeline definition can also include Conditions, Workspaces, Parameters, or Resources depending on the application requirements. The following example shows the build-and-deploy pipeline, which builds an application image from a Git repository using the buildah ClusterTask resource: apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1 kind: Pipeline metadata: name: build-and-deploy spec: workspaces: - name: shared-workspacepipelineonboarding.html taskRef: name: git-clone kind: ClusterTask workspaces: - name: output workspace: shared-workspace params: - name: url value: $(params.git-url) - name: subdirectory value: \"\" - name: deleteExisting value: \"true\" - name: revision value: $(params.git-revision) - name: build-image taskRef: name: buildah kind: ClusterTask params: - name: TLSVERIFY value: \"false\" - name: IMAGE value: $(params.IMAGE) workspaces: - name: source workspace: shared-workspace runAfter: - fetch-repository - name: apply-manifests taskRef: name: apply-manifests workspaces: - name: source workspace: shared-workspace runAfter: - build-image - name: update-deployment taskRef: name: update-deployment workspaces: - name: source workspace: shared-workspace params: - name: deploymenI service that exposes a subsett value: $(params.deployment-name) - name: IMAGE value: $(params.IMAGE) runAfter: - apply-manifests A PipelineRun is the running instance of a Pipeline. It creates a Pipeline for execution with specific inputs, outputs, and execution parameters on a cluster. For each Task in the PipelineRun, the system automatically creates a corresponding TaskRun . The system executes all the Tasks in the Pipeline in the defined sequence until all Tasks are successful or a Task fails. The status field tracks and stores the progress of each TaskRun in the PipelineRun for monitoring and auditing purposes. The following example shows a PipelineRun to run the build-and-deploy Pipeline with relevant resources and parameters: apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1 kind: PipelineRun metadata: name: build-deploy-api-pipelinerun spec: pipelineRef: name: build-and-deploy params: - name: deployment-name value: vote-api - name: git-url value: https://github.com/HACBS-pipelines/vote-api.git - name: IMAGE value: image-registry.HACBS-image-registry.svc:5000/pipelines-tutorial/vote-api workspaces: - name: shared-workspace volumeClaimTemplate: spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 500Mi Workspaces declare shared storage volumes that a Task in a Pipeline needs at runtime to receive input or provide output. Instead of specifying the actual location of the volumes, Workspaces enable you to declare the filesystem or parts of the filesystem that the system requires at the runtime. A Task or Pipeline declares the Workspace and you must provide the specific location details of the volume. The volume then mounts itself in to the Workspace in a TaskRun or a PipelineRun. This separation of volume declaration from runtime storage volumes makes the Tasks reusable, flexible, and independent of the user environment. With Workspaces, you can: Store Task inputs and outputs Share data among Tasks Use it as a mount point for credentials held in Secrets Use it as a mount point for configurations held in ConfigMaps Use it as a mount point for common tools shared by an organization Create a cache of build artifacts that speed up jobs You can specify Workspaces in the TaskRun or PipelineRun using: A read-only ConfigMaps or Secret An existing PersistentVolumeClaim shared with other Tasks A PersistentVolumeClaim from a provided VolumeClaimTemplate An emptyDir that the system discards when the TaskRun completes The following example shows a code snippet of the build-and-deploy Pipeline, which declares a shared-workspace Workspace for the build-image and apply-manifests Tasks as defined in the Pipeline. apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1 kind: Pipeline metadata: name: build-and-deploy spec: workspaces: - name: shared-workspace params: ... tasks: - name: build-image taskRef: name: buildah kind: ClusterTask params: - name: TLSVERIFY value: \"false\" - name: IMAGE value: $(params.IMAGE) workspaces: - name: source workspace: shared-workspace runAfter: - fetch-repository - name: apply-manifests taskRef: name: apply-manifests workspaces: - name: source workspace: shared-workspace runAfter: - build-image Workspaces help tasks share data, and allow you to specify one or more volumes that each task in the pipeline requires during execution. You can create a persistent volume claim or provide a volume claim template that creates a persistent volume claim for you. The following code snippet of the build-deploy-api-pipelinerun PipelineRun uses a volume claim template to create a persistent volume claim for defining the storage volume for the shared-workspace Workspace used in the build-and-deploy Pipeline. apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1 kind: PipelineRun metadata: name: build-deploy-api-pipelinerun spec: pipelineRef: name: build-and-deploy params: ... workspaces: - name: shared-workspace volumeClaimTemplate: spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 500Mi Use Triggers in conjunction with pipelines to create a full-fledged CI/CD system where Kubernetes resources define the entire CI/CD execution. Triggers capture the external events, such as a Git pull request, and process them to extract key pieces of information. Mapping this event data to a set of predefined parameters triggers a series of tasks that can then create and deploy Kubernetes resources and instantiate the pipeline. For example, you define a CI/CD workflow using HACBS Pipelines for your application. The pipeline must start for any new changes to take effect in the application repository. Triggers automate this process by capturing and processing any change event and by triggering a pipeline run that deploys the new image with the latest changes. Triggers consist of the following main resources that work together to form a reusable, decoupled, and self-sustaining CI/CD system: The TriggerBinding resource validates events, extracts the fields from an event payload, and stores them as parameters. The following example shows a code snippet of the TriggerBinding resource, which extracts the Git repository information from the received event payload: apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1 kind: TriggerBinding metadata: name: vote-app spec: params: - name: git-repo-url value: $(body.repository.url) - name: git-repo-name value: $(body.repository.name) - name: git-revision value: $(body.head_commit.id) The TriggerTemplate resource acts as a standard for the way resources must be created. It specifies the way parameterized data from the TriggerBinding resource should be used. A trigger template receives input from the trigger binding, and then performs a series of actions that results in creation of new pipeline resources, and initiation of a new pipeline run. The following example shows a code snippet of a TriggerTemplate resource, which creates a pipeline run using the Git repository information received from the TriggerBinding resource you just created: apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1 kind: TriggerTemplate metadata: name: vote-app spec: params: - name: git-repo-url description: The git repository url - name: git-revision description: The git revision default: pipelines-1.4 - name: git-repo-name description: The name of the deployment to be created / patched resourcetemplates: - apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1 kind: PipelineRun metadata: name: build-deploy-$(tt.params.git-repo-name)-$(uid) spec: serviceAccountName: pipeline pipelineRef: name: build-and-deploy params: - name: deployment-name value: $(tt.params.git-repo-name) - name: git-url value: $(tt.params.git-repo-url) - name: git-revision value: $(tt.params.git-revision) - name: IMAGE value: image-registry.HACBS-image-registry.svc:5000/pipelines-tutorial/$(tt.params.git-repo-name) workspaces: - name: shared-workspace volumeClaimTemplate: spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 500Mi The Trigger resource connects the TriggerBinding and TriggerTemplate resources, and this Trigger resource is referenced in the EventListener specification. The following example shows a code snippet of a Trigger resource, named vote-trigger that connects the TriggerBinding and TriggerTemplate resources. apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1 kind: Trigger metadata: name: vote-trigger spec: serviceAccountName: pipeline bindings: - ref: vote-app template: ref: vote-app The EventListener resource provides an endpoint, or an event sink, that listens for incoming HTTP-based events with a JSON payload. It extracts event parameters from each TriggerBinding resource, and then processes this data to create Kubernetes resources as specified by the corresponding TriggerTemplate resource. The EventListener resource also performs lightweight event processing or basic filtering on the payload using event interceptors, which identify the type of payload and optionally modify it. Currently, pipeline triggers support four types of interceptors: Webhook Interceptors, GitHub Interceptors, GitLab Interceptors, and Common Expression Language (CEL) Interceptors. The following example shows an EventListener resource, which references the Trigger resource named vote-trigger. apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1 kind: EventListener metadata: name: vote-app spec: serviceAccountName: pipeline triggers: - triggerRef: vote-trigger Triggers in HACBS Pipelines support both HTTP (insecure) and HTTPS (secure HTTP) connections to the Eventlistener resource. With the secure HTTPS connection, you get end-to-end secure connection within and outside the cluster. After you create a namespace, you can enable this secure HTTPS connection for the Eventlistener resource by adding the operator.tekton.dev/enable-annotation=enabled label to the namespace, and then creating a Trigger resource and a secured route using re-encrypt TLS termination.","title":"Pipeline concepts","component":"ROOT","version":"master","name":"pipeline_concepts","url":"/concepts/pipelines/pipeline_concepts.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

How HACBS release services help you 2. Managed workspaces 3. Release strategy and release pipeline 4. Additional resources HACBS has four components one of which is the release service. The HACBS release service helps the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) administrators to manage a managed workspace. Inside the managed workspace, HACBS release service relies on the release strategy to define the release pipeline that first validates the application snapshot, the content of your application, against the enterprise contract and then releases that content. If you want your application deployed into the custody of a supporting team like an SRE team, that team creates a managed workspace based on your original development workspace. The SREs use the release link to define the relationship between the original and managed workspace. The release link includes three pieces of data: Application name Remote workspace name The release strategy With this data, the release link connects the workspaces to ensure consistency and delegates the releases between them to maintain maximum productivity. Inside the managed workspace, the SREs rely on the release strategy to deploy your application. The release custom resource provides the application snapshot and the release link. The application snapshot includes everything that you want deployed in your application, and the release link defines where the application is deployed and what strategy is being followed. The release strategy contains the release pipeline. The pipeline defines the process to validate the snapshot against the enterprise contract to meet security standards and to release your content.

Annotations This document is meant to assist policy authors in creating and maintaining the policy rules defined in this repository. Policy rules must contain certain annotations that describe additional information about the rule. title: (required) short description of the policy rule. description: (required) descriptive information about the policy rule, including possible remediation steps. custom: (required) object holding additional non-default rego annotations. custom.foo means the foo annotation nested under this object. custom.short_name: (required) unique name of the policy rule. This is used as the value of the code attribute when reporting failures and warnings. It is also the value used for skipping the policy rule via the EnterpriseContractPolicy. It must not contain spaces. Words must be joined by _, e.g. snake_case. custom.failure_msg: (required) message indicating the exact cause a policy rule did not pass. It should be as informative as possible to guide users towards remediation. The message can be in the form of a string template, allowing dynamic values to provide a more meaningful message. custom.effective_on: (optional) time stamp string in the RFC3339 format. Defaults to \"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z\". A non-passing policy rule is classified as a warning, instead of a failure, if the date represented in the custom.effective_on annotation is in the future. This is a helpful mechanism to allow the introduction of a new policy rule while allowing a certain period of time for compliance. custom.rule_data: (optional) specify additional data for the policy rule. The value must be an object where each key maps to an array of strings. This is a convenient mechanism to specify information that is used in the policy rule evaluation that may not be obvious to users. For example, the policy rule disallowed_task_step_image only allows certain registries to be used. The list of registries is defined in the annotations custom.rule_data.allowed_registry_prefixes, allowing a single source of truth for policy rule evaluation and documentation. For best results, each key in the custom.rule_data object should be a noun. The annotations must be defined at the rule scope.","title":"Policy Authoring","component":"ec-policies","version":"master","name":"authoring","url":"/ec-policies/authoring.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

See also the \"Task bundle is not acceptable\" release and policy rules where this list is used. The list of acceptable bundles is time based. A bundle that is acceptable today is not necessarily acceptable tommorrow. The list below may contain bundles that are \"too old\" and no longer acceptable. The reason for this behavior is to allow users a certain period of time to upgrade to a newer bundle. Any bundle with an effective date in the future, and the bundle with the most recent effective date not in the future are acceptable. For example, consider a list that includes the following acceptable bundles: a, effective on 2022-10-23 b, effective on 2022-10-22 c, effective on 2022-10-20 d, effective on 2022-10-19 If today is 2022-10-21, then the bundles a, b, and c are acceptable, while d is not. Even when using an acceptable bundle, some policy rules may emit a warning if the bundle is not the latest one on the list. This is an attempt to notify users that although there are no violations today, an update is required for continued compliance. In the example above, using b or c would result in such a warning.

The non_blocking_checks field 7. Data Sources It’s possible to configure which rules should be included and which should be skipped when the Enterprise Contract check runs. The way this is configured is using fields in the policy configuration as described here. Note that it’s expected that the policy configuration will be created automatically by the Enterprise Contract Task, based on data from the applicable Enterprise Contract Policy CRD, so it’s likely you won’t need to create or manage this configuration manually. The Enterprise Contract Task and the Enterprise Contract Policy CRD are documented elsewhere. TODO: Where? When the Enterprise Contract runs it will look for policy configuration in data.config.policy. The easiest way to populate that data is by adding a JSON formatted file in the data directory such as data/config.json. Here’s an example of how that file might look. { \"config\": { \"policy\": { \"include\": [\"*\"], \"exclude\": [], \"collections\": [] } } } If the policy is not defined, sensible defaults will be used. In fact the above example shows what the defaults are if the configuration is not specified. By default, all rules are included. You can modify the defaults by setting config.policy.include and config.policy.exclude. Each of those values should be a list of strings. The strings in the list should be one of the the following: A \"package name\" Package names can be found in the policy documentation, for example the Attestation Type package name is attestation_type. Specifing a package name by itself in the include or exclude list means every rule from that package should be included or excluded. A \"rule name\" A rule name consists of the rule’s package name and the rule’s \"code\" separated by a dot. Rule codes can be see in the documentation also. For example the Unknown attestation type found rule name is attestation_type.unknown_att_type. \"*\" The \"*\" acts as a wildcard to match any package. Note that it does not match partial names, so you can’t specify \"s*\" to match every package starting with \"s\" for example. You can also specify \".*\" and it works the same as just \"\" to represent every rule in a package. Distinct from skipping rules, there is a way to indicate that particular tests are not strictly required by the Enterprise Contract. This is handled as a special case for the \"test.test_result_failures\" rule only. The syntax for skipping a particular test is \"test:\" and it only works with the exclude field. You can’t use it with the include option. The examples here are shown as the contents of config.policy formatted as YAML for brevity and readability. Note that you can omit fields where the default value is what you need. This would include all rules except for rules from the two specified packages. All other rules would be included. exclude: - attestation_task_bundle - slsa_build_scripted_build This would include just the rules from the specified packages and exclude all other rules. include: - test - java This would include all rules except for the unacceptable_task_bundle rule in the attestation_task_bundle package. The other rules in the attestation_task_bundle would be included. exclude: - attestation_task_bundle.unacceptable_task_bundle This example shows how to specify that the Enterprise Contract is allowed to pass even if certain tests failed or didn’t complete. exclude: - test:get-clair-scan - test:clamav-scan You can specify both include and exclude to pick out just the rules you want. This example specifies that only the unacceptable_task_bundle rule from the attestation_task_bundle package should be included. The other rules in the attestation_task_bundle would be excluded. Notice the higher specificity include rule takes precedence over the exclude rule in this example. include: - \"*\" - attestation_task_bundle.unacceptable_task_bundle exclude: - attestation_task_bundle.* Rather than specifying the values of include and exclude explicitly, you can also select from a set of predefined configurations by setting \"data.config.policy.collections\". For example, in a data/config.json file: { \"config\": { \"policy\": { \"collections\": [\"some_things\", \"some_other_things\"] } } } Name Description slsa1 Includes policy rules required to meet SLSA Level 1. Rules included: slsa2 Includes policy rules required to meet SLSA Level 2. Special attention must be given to two requirements which are not covered by the policy rules in this collection. The first is \"Provenance - Authenticated\" which is expected to be performed when fetching the attestation via cosign or ec-cli. The second requirement is \"Provenace - Service Generated\" which is a little more complex to verify. By meeting both the \"Provenance - Authenticated\" AND \"Build - Build Service\" requirements, we can have some confidence that this requirement is met since Chains is a service that generates signed attestations with data obtained from the build service (Tekton Pipelines). Rules included: slsa3 Includes policy rules required to meet SLSA Level 3. This is currently a work in progress and functionally the same as the slsa2 collection. Rules included: Policy rules may specify a custom.collections metadata attribute as a list of strings. Each string represents a collection the policy rule is included in. The non_blocking_checks configuration option, previously used to skip rules is now deprecated. It’s functionality is replaced with the new exclude option as described above. While it’s deprecated it can still be used interchangeably with the exclude field. Please make the required tooling changes soon to prevent breakages when the non_blocking_checks field is removed in the future. Some of the Enterprise Contract policy rules, defined in the ec-policies git repository, rely on certain data values when evaluated. For example, a policy rule exists to ensure all the parent container images used during the build process have been retrieved from an acceptable registry. The list of acceptable registries is a data value. This type of data is called Rule Data. In addition to policy rules, the ec-policies git repository also defines values for Rule Data, see rule_data.yml . As a user, you can provide a custom data source with modified Rule Data allowing the same policy rules to be used to best fit your use cases. There are different ways to create a custom data source. The simplest form is to fork the ec-policies git repository and change the values of data/rule_data.yml in your fork. Then, simply provide your fork as a data source. For example: { \"sources\": [ { \"policy\": [ \"git::https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies.git//policy\" ], \"data\": [ \"git::https://github.com/lcarva/ec-policies.git//data\" ] } ] } It is also possible to provide an OPA bundle as a data source, for example: { \"sources\": [ { \"policy\": [ \"git::https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies.git//policy\" ], \"data\": [ \"oci::quay.io/lucarval/policy-data:latest\" ] } ] } If the data source contains policy rules, those will be ignored. If you replace the default data source entirely, you must provide the full set of required data values. These are all the values defined in data/rule_data.yml and data/acceptable_tekton_bundles.yml. It’s also possible to add an additional data source containing rule data defined under the rule_data_custom top level key. Data under this key will take precedence over data defined under the rule_data top level key. So, for example you could use the default data source and still define your own values for allowed_registry_prefixes by adding a second data source that includes a file such as: rule_data_custom: allowed_registry_prefixes: - trusted-registry.io/trusted-images/ - docker.io/acme-company/","title":"Policy Configuration","component":"ec-policies","version":"master","name":"policy_configuration","url":"/ec-policies/policy_configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For any image reference matching the catalog-repo-base, Tekton Hub is consulted to determine the latest version of the task, and its latest image reference. The original image reference is then replaced with its latest version. If one or more image parameters are provided, they will also be used to replace image references matching the same OCI repository. For example, the image reference \"example.com/repo:1.2\" would replace the image reference \"example.com/repo:1.1\". The provided image reference can inlude a tag, a digest, or both. If a digest is not provided, this command will query the repository for this value. The following source types are supported: file: simply a file accessible by the local file system.

If a digest is not provided, this command will query the registry to determine its value. Either a tag or a digest is required.

The first validation stage determines if an image has been signed, and the signature matches the provided public key. This is akin to the \"cosign verify\" command. The second validation stage determines if one or more attestations exist, and those attestations have been signed matching the provided public key, similarly to the \"cosign verify-attestation\" command. This stage temporarily stores the attestations for usage in the next stage. The final stage verifies the attestations conform to rego policies defined in the EnterpriseContractPolicy.
